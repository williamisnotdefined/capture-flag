# API App Architecture

`apps/api` is a NestJS API backed by Prisma and PostgreSQL.

## Request Flow

- Controllers define routes, parse params, receive DTOs, and pass `request.user.id` to services.
- Session-only private controllers use `SessionGuard` and `AuthenticatedRequest`.
- API-token-capable management controllers use `AuthenticatedApiGuard`, then API token tenant/scope guards.
- DTO classes validate and normalize request bodies.
- UUID route params use `ParseUUIDPipe` in controllers.
- Services own authorization, existence checks, ownership checks, business rules, and Prisma calls.

## Persistence

- Prisma schema and migrations define the data model.
- Prisma access is injected through `PrismaService`.
- Tenant checks usually resolve parent entities before child reads or writes.
- Constraint and uniqueness errors are mapped through the shared Prisma exception filter.

## Public SDK Boundary

- Public SDK config routes are unauthenticated by session.
- SDK keys authenticate public config access through hashed key lookup.
- SDK evaluation context never reaches the API.
- Public config output is a versioned SDK contract, not an internal API DTO.
