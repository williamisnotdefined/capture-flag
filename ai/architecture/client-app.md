# Client App Architecture

`apps/client` is a Vite React application for the Capture Flag platform UI.

## Entry And Routing

- `src/main.tsx` owns top-level providers.
- `src/router.tsx` owns React Router route definitions.
- `src/layouts` contains route layout wrappers that render shared shells, navigation, headers, and nested `<Outlet />` regions.
- `src/pages` contains route-level screens.
- `src/components` contains shared UI used by multiple pages or sections.
- `PlatformLayout` owns the authenticated shell, top-level resource context, and navigation around selected organization, project, config, and environment.

## Route Map

- `/login`: GitHub login screen.
- `/organizations` and `/organizations/:organizationId`: organization selection and organization members.
- `/organizations/:organizationId/projects` and `/organizations/:organizationId/projects/:projectId`: project selection and project members.
- `/organizations/:organizationId/projects/:projectId/environments`: environments for the selected project.
- `/organizations/:organizationId/projects/:projectId/configs` and `/organizations/:organizationId/projects/:projectId/configs/:configId`: configs and public Config JSON preview.
- `/organizations/:organizationId/projects/:projectId/configs/:configId/flags`: feature flags and remote config values.
- `/organizations/:organizationId/projects/:projectId/configs/:configId/segments`: reusable targeting segments.
- `/organizations/:organizationId/projects/:projectId/sdk-keys`: SDK key lifecycle for project configs/environments.
- `/organizations/:organizationId/audit-logs`: organization/project audit log timeline.

## Data Flow

- React Query owns server state such as authenticated user, organizations, projects, configs, environments, SDK keys, members, and feature flags.
- API operations live under `src/api/<domain>/<operation>`.
- Request functions perform HTTP calls and contain no React imports.
- Query and mutation hooks are the UI-facing API.
- Mutation hooks invalidate affected query keys.
- Route params and server state are combined by `useRouteContext` for selected resources and redirect-safe navigation paths.
- Permission gates in the client are UX only; API guards and services remain authoritative.

## UI Composition

- Route components compose page sections and own screen-level flow.
- Repeated panels, forms, controls, lists, and empty states move into named components.
- React component files should stay at or below 400 lines by splitting real responsibilities into focused files.
- Short, fixed navigation or action sets should be rendered explicitly instead of through artificial arrays.
- Page-specific components stay colocated under the page folder until reused elsewhere.
- Layout-specific components stay colocated under `src/layouts/<LayoutName>` until reused by another layout or page.
- Shared primitives live under `src/components` and are exported through `src/components/index.ts`.
- Member management uses shared `components/members` primitives with page-specific role options.
- Feature flag and segment page internals stay colocated under their page folders until reused.

## Form Flow

- React Hook Form owns field state and submission.
- Zod schemas parse and validate form values.
- API mutation hooks submit normalized payloads and refresh server state.
