# Good SDK Key Service

Why this is canonical:

- Separates raw SDK key display from hashed persistence.
- Requires project admin access before key creation/revocation.
- Audits SDK key lifecycle without storing the raw credential.
- Rejects duplicate revocation attempts to avoid audit churn.

## Raw Key And Hash

```ts
const rawKey = createRawSdkKey();
const keyPrefix = rawKey.slice(0, 18);
const keyHash = hashSdkKey(rawKey);
```

Only `keyHash` and `keyPrefix` are persisted.

## Creation Return Shape

```ts
return {
  ...sdkKey,
  key: rawKey,
};
```

The raw key is returned only immediately after creation.
