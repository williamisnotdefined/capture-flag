# API Tenant Access Rules

Rules for private API authorization and tenant isolation.

## Always

- Use `SessionGuard` and `AuthenticatedRequest` on private API controllers.
- Keep controllers thin: parse route params, pass `request.user.id`, and delegate rules to services.
- Enforce tenant access through `AccessService` before returning or mutating tenant-owned data.
- Resolve parent organization, project, config, environment, SDK key, or flag and verify it belongs to the current tenant path.
- Use `requireProjectAccess` for project-scoped reads.
- Use `requireProjectRole` for project-scoped writes with the narrowest allowed project roles.
- Use `requireOrganizationMember` or `requireOrganizationRole` for organization-level reads and writes.
- Preserve the rule that organization `owner` and `admin` roles can satisfy project access without explicit project membership.
- Preserve owner safety: organization admins cannot create, change, or remove organization owners, and organizations must keep at least one owner.
- Keep project `developer` scoped to feature flag writes; do not allow it to manage segments, SDK keys, environments, configs, project members, or roles.

## Never

- Do not trust global IDs alone.
- Do not leak cross-tenant data through `include` or nested `select` shapes.
- Do not perform private API reads or writes before access checks.
- Do not expose whether a public SDK key ever existed when it is missing or revoked.
- Do not make public SDK endpoints depend on session auth; they authenticate through hashed SDK keys.

## Required Domain Checks

- `configId` and `environmentId` must belong to the same `projectId` before SDK keys, flag values, or config state changes.
- Project ownership must be validated before listing configs, environments, members, SDK keys, and feature flags.
- Organization ownership must be validated before adding organization or project members.
- Segment mutations require project administrative access because segments are reusable targeting assets shared by flag rules.
